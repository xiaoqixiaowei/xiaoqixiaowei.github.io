My name is Jason, a graduate student majoring in communication engineering.  I have the following qualities:

- I am always enthusiastic
- Basketball lovers

### My story

In addition to my major, I am also addicted to creating something fancy. So I will also share something about embedded development and programming. 
This website records my notes and shares some understanding of my recent work.
